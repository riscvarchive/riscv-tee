== Motivation

The major goal of M-mode secondary context extension is to offer a way for trusted OSes, services, and drivers to run on M-mode, which can be isolated from the secure monitor and firmware and from each other.

Having all those elements (OSes, services, and drivers) running at the highest privilege together with the secure monitor, without memory isolation between them, increases the attack surface of the system.
Moreover, some or all of these elements may be third-party proprietary binaries outside the vendor's control and trust domain.
On a system with S-mode available, we would have the secure monitor on M-mode and those elements on S-mode, but on an M/U-only system we are constrained.

We propose this proposal to provide primary and secondary contexts on M-mode, achieving isolation between different contexts.
The extension targets M/U-only systems.
